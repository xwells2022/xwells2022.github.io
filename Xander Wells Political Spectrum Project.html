However, it was also the job of the community to look over the weak and the job of the state to encourage education, culture, and physical welfare.`

He also believed that the state of nature was self-governed and that people would be civil even without religion.`,

Determined by popular vote, the general will is always right and tends to the public advantage. Although the general will might not align perfectly with everyone’s individual wills, individuals obey the general rule nonetheless, and it serves them as often as possible.`
